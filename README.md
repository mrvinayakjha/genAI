## DAY-0 Introduction to Generative AI

- Before Going further in Generative AI lets revisit the DeepLearning for more understanding:
      - ANN (Artificial Neural network): working with Numerical/Categorical/Structured data -> which solves problems related to Clasification and Regression
      - CNN(Colvulution Neural Network): Feature Extraction -> Pulling -> Flatten the Layer (Colvulution) + ANN
      - RNN(): Sequence Related Data -> Feedback Loop
      - Reinforcement Learning:
      - GAN(Generative Adversial Network)
- ### What is Generative AI?
      - GenAI generate a new Data, based on Training sample. Generative Model can generate image, text, Audio, Videos, etc Data As output.
      - GenAI is a subset of DeepLearning and Generative Models are trained on huge amount of data. While training the Generative Model We don't need to provide a label data., so it is not possible when we have a huge amount of data, so, its just try to see the relationship between the distribution of the data.
